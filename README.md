# Sprint 0 - Paper tower

For our first sprint we will be practicing the process of design, and submission of sprints using Github.

You will document and submit your design process in this GitHub repository. Your design process will involve all of the stages that you will show in each stage of our RoboCup project, but for this first sprint we will be working without technology.

## Goal

For your roboCup sprints you will be setting your own goals that can be completed within a given time (usually two weeks). For our first sprint your goal will be given to you and will be completed in one week.

`Create a design for the tallest possible tower using a single sheet of plain printer paper`

### Restrictions

- No tape, glue, water or other adhesive
- No supports
- Must stand for 30 seconds
- Cutting is allowed
- Normal earth gravity
- Standard paper weight
- sheet size 8.5x11 inches (letter)

You will submit the instructions and diagrams that would allow another to make your designed tower, 

## Process

You will follow the steps outlined below (for both this sprint and those for our RoboCup design).

### Research

I did a couple of minutes of research and I found that most towers were built with tape, so I looked for ones that didn't. The ones that didn't use tape, instead used cuts and incisions on both sides of the paper so they could interconnect and be quite sturdy. I also found out that from most of the towers were built, they were either super focused on the base so it could be stable, or the weight was focused on top. I opted for the first option. Plus I got a hole puncher, so that could act as the stabilizer, as it could roll a piece of paper and slide it through the hole, connecting paper, to paper, like how the Japanese built homes to be secure against hurricanes and tsunamis, I had a support pole in the middle acting as the spine.


### Ideation

### Prototyping
My first initial prototype had a base that was shaped into a circle, and I used a hole puncher to punch holes so I can put stabilizers (an inch wide piece of paper that was rolled into a cylinder and acted as a stabilizer) underneath and through the circle. That was my base and I thought it was pretty secure. No shakes and swaying.

### Testing and Critique

The part that was going to be my 'tower' was the corner from one end to the other end of the A4 paper (since we were only allowed to use one). It was the furthest corner from the other corner and I cut that part out to act as my tower. I hole punched the top of the circle so I can have the antennae (what I am going to call the long piece of paper) be secure and not fall anywhere. 
The problem was that it was floppy. I then experimented and few things and found that if I just fold the paper into two, I can still make it super sturdy and stiff, while maintaining the height. I then took another piece of paper and folded it into half to act as a 'extender' through punching holes to my main antennae, then looping the extender through the holes so it wouldn't fall. 
There was a problem. I flipped it around and instead, had my main piece act as the extender and had punched the holes through. Since the main part was supposed to be thicker so it can hold the extender, I was supposed to hole punch that.

Unfortunately, I use the thicker piece of paper and used it to be the extender, so it was heavier and weighed down the extender, which was thin and long. It ultimately fell down. 

### Final design & Conclusion

The second prototype; this time I had my pieces laid out  in front of me so it was neat and tidy. This made it easier to know what would act as that and this, and where I should put it. I didn't mention this before, but my first prototype had a lot of holes in the base, as well as in the main antennae, so it was already sort of floppy. The plan was to have the base secure with four legs in and out so the base wouldn't move. Then have a pole in the middle poking out on top so I could connect the next halo to make the second base. Next was to have the main piece punched through the hole on the second base thatâ€™s connected to the first, so it would act as the pole in the middle. I made sure to fold the paper in half so it wouldn't be floppy. Then I punched a hole in the main piece so I can attach the extender through. The less weight was on the top, the better it can hold itself.
